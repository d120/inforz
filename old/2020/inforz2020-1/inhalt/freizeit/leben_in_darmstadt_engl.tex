{Just studying isn't everything: Students should also find time for leisure activities. This section guides you through what Darmstadt has to offer.
}{
    The previous pages were all about the academic side of your studies. But there is another important part: leisure time. It serves as counter balance to an exhausting day and replenishes energy to take on the next day. It also helps us to clear our head from time to time.

    That's why it is so important, especially during strenuous weeks, to plan for regular breaks and leisure time. Studying is important but a clear head makes it a lot easier. Maybe an assignment needs to be finished - if you don't wait to start on the last day before the deadline you won't have to work on it all night.

    Everyone has their own idea of how to spend their leisure time but a good mix consisting of social interactivity (parties, game nights, cooking nights, etc.) and doing some sports is always recommended. The following pages shall help you to get to know what Darmstadt has to offer and to create your own personal leisure time.
