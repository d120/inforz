\artikel{Methods of Teaching and Learning}
{The methods of teaching at TU Darmstadt may differ from those you already know. In this article you get to know the most used methods for teaching.
}{
	A course may consist of several teaching methods, for example a lecture and an exercise.
	In Darmstadt a course starts at the time mentioned in the schedule. All our courses will start s.t (sine tempore) - expect something else is mentioned explicitly.
